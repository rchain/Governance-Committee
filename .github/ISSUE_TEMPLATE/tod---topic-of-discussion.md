### Before raising a Topic of Discussion (ToD)

Candidate topics of discussion should first be discussed with other members so that there has been a degree of peer review before invoking this formal process.  Discussion can take place in any appropriate collaboration channel or tool.  Members must make reasonable effort to reach out to and at least inform all parties impacted in the candidate ToD.

Topics of discussion are normally raised in ‘business as usual’ agenda-setting process for the governance body relevant<sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup> to the topic.  Each committee, body or business unit has a membership representative who may be contacted in order to table the item in the agenda/decision-making process operated by that unit. 

### When to Raise a Formal ToD

ToD’s may be raised where:

*   there is no obvious accountable/responsible body already in existing co-op governance to address the candidate topic, or
*   the ToD is deemed to be of ‘board level significance’<sup>[3](#myfootnote1)</sup> and is not already on the Co-op Board agenda, or

*   the topic has already been submitted, but the proposer and a significant number of peers feel that the topic has not been properly addressed and requires escalation as a dispute or unresolved matter for arbitration and final settlement.

### How to Raise a Formal ToD

*   Create a ToD document, ideally, in collaboration with peers, that should include: \
 \
**Title:** short (50 char max) but informative
**Description** of ToD (no more than 1 page)
**Context**:  link to previous discussion / documents and history of previous submission and outcomes.
**Impact** statement:  on co-op ongoing costs, effort, third party / external impact, reputation, external valuation etc.  (Must include timing of impacts, quantified wherever possible - link)
**Benefits** statement
(Must include timing of benefits, quantified wherever possible - link)
**Implementation** Costs, Plan and Risk Assessment  (links)
**Time frame** for discussion - allowing reasonable time to adjust the ToD, if necessary, and for the proposed consultation _mechanism_
**Governance Bodies** to be advised:  e.g. Board, Finance and Audit, or Governance (in the case of a governance change)
**Mechanism** proposed for expressing collective sentiment / making decision, including pre and post consultation.  (This should be discussed with the Governance Committee)
**Change Log** to record any significant changes to the ToD  (what, who, why, when etc)
